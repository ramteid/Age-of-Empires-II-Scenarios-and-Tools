# Age of Empires II - The Conquerors
## _Scenarios, Random Map scripts and Tools_

I used to be an enthusiastic AoE2 player on MSN Gaming Zone with emphasis on playing custom scenarios. As AoE II is played more frequently with the release of _Definitive Edition_ now again, I feel like sharing the original scenarios and tools from the old days, which are still playable today.

## Scenarios

In _Age of Empires II Definitive Edition_, you can locate the scenario directory ingame: There's a button at _"Single Player -> Editors -> Open scenario directory"_, which opens a directory like:
_C:\Users\<username>\Games\Age of Empires 2 DE\<someNumber>\resources\_common\scenario_
Copy scenario files there.


## Random

In the original _The Conquerors_, you could write random map scripts to define your own random maps without triggers. Aparently, _Definitive Edition_ supports them, too.

## Tools

### Random Map Script Generator
Generates random map scripts. 

### SaveGame Tool
Extracts information from Savegame files (.mgz, .mgx). Apparently the ingame chat history only.

### AOK Trigger Studio (AOKTS)
Powerful external scenario editor tool. Supports copying triggers, garrisoning units within other units, etc.
Strong recommendation if you are into scenario editing. Supports _Definitive Edition_ scenarios.
